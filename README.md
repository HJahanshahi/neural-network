**Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set - Artificial Neural Network Regression**

This repository contains an implementation of an artificial neural network (ANN) for regression using Python and the Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set. The data set contains hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH), and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of a combined cycle power plant.

Data Set Information
The data set contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH), and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant. A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST), and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is collected from and has an effect on the Steam Turbine, the other three ambient variables affect the GT performance.

The data set is provided in both .ods and .xlsx formats, and is shuffled five times to allow for 5x2 fold statistical tests to be carried out. For each shuffling, 2-fold cross-validation is carried out and the resulting 10 measurements are used for statistical testing.

**Getting Started**
To run this code on your local machine, you'll need to have Python 3 and the following packages installed:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
tensorflow
Alternatively, you can use a cloud-based platform such as Google Colab to run the code without installing anything on your local machine.



**Implementation Details**
The ANN consists of an input layer with 4 neurons (one for each ambient variable), two hidden layers with 6 neurons each, and an output layer with 1 neuron (for the predicted EP). The neural network uses the ReLU activation function for the hidden layers. The mean squared error loss function is used to measure the difference between the predicted and actual output.

The ANN is trained using mini-batch gradient descent with a batch size of 32. The training process consists of 100 epochs, with the training data shuffled after each epoch.

**Results**
After training the ANN on the CCPP data set, the mean squared error on the test set was found to be around 26.
